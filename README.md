Twitter Bot Detection using Contrastive Learning in NLP. 

In our project, we apply the concept of contrastive learning (CL) to detect if a tweet is generated by a bot or if it is a human-generated tweet. We train a CL model using SimCSE  tweet dataset to generate embeddings for tweets. We train a classifier using these embeddings while freezing the embedding parameters during training.
